# Final-Project
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme
I interperpreted the theme as havign to do the opposite of what you think you needed to do. Having things in reverse.

## Game Play
Objective
the objective is to rack up as many points as you can with before the time runs out.
Game-play instructions
you use the keys to move the square to the smaller sqaure to gain points

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game
It was hard to execute all of these parts on my own and not with a group. I had to end up with a super simple game because in the time limit and balancing other work it was very hard,

## Implementation
features: 
Color
time clock
score
and movement controlled by keys
